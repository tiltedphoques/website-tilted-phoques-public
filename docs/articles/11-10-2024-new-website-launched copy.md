# The relaunch of the Titled Phoques website!

After months of relentless effort, countless brainstorming sessions, and cups of coffee that could fuel a rocket, the day had finally arrived. The team at Tilted Phoques gathered in the jet-fueled discord call, excitement bubbling in the air as they prepared to launch their **official website**. 

### A Labor of Love

Each member of the team had poured their heart and soul into this project. From the developers who coded late into the night, to the designers who meticulously crafted every pixel, the dedication was palpable. They had envisioned a platform that not only showcased their offerings but also served as a vibrant community hub for their users.

Finally, the moment came. With a few clicks, the new website went live at **[tiltedphoques.com](https://tiltedphoques.com)**. The homepage glowed with colors that reflected the essence of Tilted Phoques, inviting visitors to explore, learn, and engage. 

### The Importance of Authenticity

However, as the team celebrated, they noticed something troubling. Other websites were claiming to be the official Tilted Phoques site, misleading users and even potentially scamming them. These impostors were not only diluting the brand but also jeopardizing the safety and experience of loyal fans and newcomers alike.

In a world rife with misinformation, the team knew it was vital to set the record straight. They quickly issued a statement on social media and within their website:

> **"Beware of misleading websites! The only official Tilted Phoques website is [tiltedphoques.com](https://tiltedphoques.com). Any other sites claiming to represent Tilted Phoques are not affiliated with us and may be scams. Your safety and trust are our top priority."**
